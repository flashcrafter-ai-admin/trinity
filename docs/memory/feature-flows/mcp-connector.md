# Per-Agent MCP Connector (ent#46; OSS-core since #118)

Expose one agent as a per-agent MCP connector: an end user adds it to their AI
client (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop) in one line, and the agent's
`user_invocable` playbooks become MCP tools. The agent holds all credentials
server-side; only a scoped, revocable key reaches the client.

Shipped entitlement-gated in v0.8.0 (`mcp_connector`); **relocated into OSS core
by #118** — the router/service/db moved from the private enterprise submodule into
the public repo and the entitlement gate was dropped front and back. Part B
(email-auth onboarding, #848) is deferred pending design sign-off.

## Layers

| Layer | File | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Router | `src/backend/routers/connector.py` | `/api/agents/{name}/connector*`, mounted unconditionally in `main.py` (no `requires_entitlement`) |
| Service (pure) | `src/backend/services/connector_service.py` | `build_snippets`, `resolve_exposed_playbooks`, `connector_name` |
| DB | `src/backend/db/connector.py` (`ConnectorOperations`) | config CRUD + key mint/regenerate/revoke; facade delegators on `database.py` (`db.get_connector_config`, …) |
| Models | `src/backend/models.py` | `ConnectorConfigUpdate/Status/KeySecret/Playbook/ClientSnippet` (Invariant #14) |
| MCP tools | `src/mcp-server/src/tools/connector.ts` | `list_playbooks` / `run_playbook` / `ask` — `connectorOnly` `canAccess` (already OSS) |
| Auth fence | `src/backend/dependencies.py` | `_enforce_connector_scope` / `_reject_connector_principal` — edition-agnostic (already OSS) |
| UI | `components/ConnectorChannelPanel.vue` + `ExposedToolsPanel.vue` | in `SharingPanel.vue`, un-gated (#118) |
| UI (2nd surface) | `components/McpExposedPanel.vue` "Connect an external client" section | #1575: one-click **Copy connection config** on the #846 Expose-via-MCP panel (Settings tab), shown when `mcp_exposed` is on. Reuses the SAME connector endpoints (`GET/POST/DELETE /connector[/key]`) + `ExposedToolsPanel` picker — mint-or-reuse the scoped key, copy the `.mcp.json` (with the live key embedded, via `utils/clipboard.copyToClipboard`), regenerate/revoke. No new backend/key/endpoint. Copy-once secret: an existing key re-copies the placeholder config and offers "Regenerate & copy" for a fresh live key |

## Endpoints (all under `/api/agents`)

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| GET | `/{name}/connector` | `OwnedAgentByName` | Owner status: enabled, allow-list, `has_key`, `key_prefix`, `mcp_url`, snippets (placeholder key) |
| PUT | `/{name}/connector` | `OwnedAgentByName` | Set enable + `exposed_playbooks` (or `expose_all_playbooks` to clear the allow-list) |
| POST | `/{name}/connector/key` | `OwnedAgentByName` | Mint/regenerate the scoped key — **secret returned once**; auto-enables; snippets embed the real key. Atomic delete-old + insert-new (single-active-key invariant) |
| DELETE | `/{name}/connector/key` | `OwnedAgentByName` | Revoke all connector-scoped keys (idempotent) |
| GET | `/{name}/connector/playbooks` | `AuthorizedAgentByName` (accepts a `scope='connector'` key) | Effective exposed playbooks the connector advertises |
| POST | `/{name}/task/sealed` | distinct `scope='sealed_executor'` key bound to one agent | Execute one exact synchronous signed operation; this principal cannot authenticate to MCP or any ordinary agent route |

## Key + policy

- **Connector key**: a row in the OSS `mcp_api_keys` table with `scope='connector'`,
  `agent_name` bound. Generated/hashed via `McpKeyOperations` so
  `validate_mcp_api_key` recognizes it. The OSS auth fence fences a connector key
  to its documented chat/playbook connector surface; it cannot reach owner ops or
  another agent.
- **Sealed-executor key**: a separate row with `scope='sealed_executor'` and one
  bound `agent_name`. It is rejected by the central MCP validation surface and may
  reach only `POST /{agent}/task/sealed`. That route adds a body-aware fail-closed
  gate: it requires one exact signed operation grant, synchronous execution,
  `Bash` as the only tool, bounded turns, an idempotency key, and no session, file,
  model, prompt, timeout, result-injection, or caller-attribution headers. The
  backend dispatches only to the agent's dedicated internal `/api/task/sealed`
  endpoint, which is absent from legacy images and has no fallback to the ordinary
  task endpoint. Sealed request keys and primitive types are checked before
  Pydantic normalization, and execution stops before persistence if the required
  idempotency claim cannot be established.
- **Allow-list** (`enterprise_connectors.exposed_playbooks`, JSON array; NULL ⇒ all
  `user_invocable`): `resolve_exposed_playbooks` drops `user_invocable:false`
  unconditionally (even if explicitly listed); `automation:gated` is passed through
  as advisory metadata (not a filter).

## Schema / migration

`enterprise_connectors` (one row per agent: `enabled`, `exposed_playbooks`,
`created_at`, `updated_at`). The name is **kept from the enterprise era** so an
existing enterprise install adopts its data with zero migration (`CREATE TABLE IF
NOT EXISTS` on the same name — no data copy, no duplicate-table drift). Dual-track:
SQLite `db/migrations.py:enterprise_connectors_table` + Alembic
`0015_enterprise_connectors`; DDL in `db/schema.py`, MetaData in `db/tables.py`;
delete/rename cascade via the `enterprise_connectors` `AGENT_REF`. The enterprise
Alembic `0006_mcp_connector` is neutralized to a no-op (its descendant
`0007` keeps the chain).

## Deferred — Part B (email-auth onboarding, #848)

An external user on the agent's `agent_sharing` allow-list authenticates from their
MCP client via the email 6-digit-code flow (`request_login`/`verify_login` MCP
tools) and uses the connector **without a pre-minted key**, seeing only the exposed
playbooks of agents shared with their email. Blocked on #848's open design questions
(persistent key vs transient session; post-login tool visibility; whitelist-only vs
open signup). Not built.
