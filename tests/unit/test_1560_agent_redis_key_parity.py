"""Parity enforcement for the per-agent Redis keyspace registry (Issue #1560).

``services/agent_runtime_state.py`` promises to be the single enumeration point
for every Redis keyspace keyed by **agent name**, so that the next contributor to
add one cannot silently forget to clear it on delete / rename / purge / recreate.
This is that check — the Redis-side twin of
``tests/unit/test_agent_cleanup_parity.py``, which does the same job for the SQL
``AGENT_REFS`` registry.

The failure mode it guards is exactly the one that produced #1560: a keyspace
(``agent:circuit:{name}``) that outlived the agent it described, so a fresh,
healthy container inheriting the name was fast-failed as "unhealthy" by its
predecessor's verdict.

The check is bidirectional:

  forward   — every ``"agent:<segment>"`` string literal in ``src/backend`` is
              either cleared (``CLEARED_KEYSPACES``) or consciously exempted
              (``EXEMPT_KEYSPACES``, which carries the reason).
  backward  — every registered prefix still appears somewhere in the backend
              (catches a stale entry after a keyspace is renamed or removed).

``agent_runtime_state.py`` keeps its service imports function-local precisely so
this test can load it with the stdlib alone — no redis, no fastapi, no docker.
It is therefore a real CI gate and does NOT skip when the backend venv is absent.
